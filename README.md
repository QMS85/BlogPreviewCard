# What I learned
Looking at your blog preview card project, there are several impressive aspects worth highlighting:

## 1. Clean and Semantic HTML Structure:
The HTML in index.html is well-organized using semantic elements like ```<main>```, ```<article>```, and appropriate content hierarchy.
This shows good attention to accessibility and SEO practices.

## 2. Sophisticated CSS Hover Effects:
The card hover animation in style.css is particularly elegant:
```
.card:hover {
  box-shadow: 12px 12px 0 var(--gray-950);
  transform: translate(-4px, -4px);
}
```
This creates a smooth, engaging lift effect that enhances user interaction while maintaining simplicity.

## 3. Responsive Design:
The mobile-first approach with a clean media query breakpoint at 375px shows good responsive design practices.

## 4. CSS Custom Properties:
The use of CSS variables (custom properties) for colors makes the code more maintainable and consistent:
```
:root {
  --yellow: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
  --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  --gray-500: hsl(0, 0%, 42%);
  --gray-950: hsl(0, 0%, 7%);
}
```

## 5. Performance Optimization:
Using modern image formats (webp) for the avatar image and SVG for illustrations shows consideration for performance.
